                            <li>Research the agency and your potential creative partners.</li>
                            <li>Have some insightful questions ready to go.</li>
                            <li>Be on time. Better yet, be a bit early.</li>

                            <li>Be prepared to talk about your work, and how it specifically aligns with the

                            </li>
                            <li>If you have technical difficulties, suggest a phone call or reschedule.</li>
                            <li>Don't forget to follow up with an email and say thank you. Itâ€™s appreciated!</li>
                            <li>Most of all, be yourself.</li>
                        </ul>
