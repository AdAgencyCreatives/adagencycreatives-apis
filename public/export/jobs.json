        "post_content": "About the job\n\nWe have a simple belief \u2014 Unexpected Works. It means that the best idea is the one you never saw coming. The thing that catches you so off guard that you can\u2018t look away. And the only path to genuinely unexpected works is through creativity. Not just what passes for creativity because it answers a brief, looks the part and helps everyone sleep at night. But creativity that is foreign, surprising and interesting enough to cause jaws to drop and sales to soar. It\u2019s having the fresh perspective and raw energy to bring something into the world that no one\u2019s ever seen before. We\u2019re talking about the courage to shake things up and maybe even tear a few things down. And knowing that what most would call the finish line is where the real work starts. We believe in people, product, and profit, in that order. For us, people always come first. They\u2019re the soul of our agency. It takes amazing folks to make amazing work. That\u2019s why we make sure everyone who comes through the door is as great as the people who are already here. It\u2019s also why we constantly strive to build diverse teams where everyone brings something unique to the table. Because you can\u2019t make the unexpected if you only work with the usual suspects. By bringing together diverse thinkers with different backgrounds and perspectives, we validate Bill Bernbach\u2019s notion that an idea can turn to dust or magic, depending on the talent that rubs against it. So, come be part of the magic.\n\nArt directors oversee the artistic design of advertisements and print materials, as well as the filming of television commercials. They are the decision makers who are responsible for the quality of the finished product. The art director chooses a photographer, an illustrator, models, and any props necessary for an ad. If a print ad comes back from the printer with an imperfection, the art director is responsible for retouching it.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\u2022 Responsible for not only the \"look\" of an ad but is also part of a creative team responsible for developing the very concept. An art director and a copywriter (who writes the ads) may decide on an advertising concept together. Then they determine how the ad will look and what it will say.\n\u2022 To create a \"print\" ad\u2014one that appears in a magazine or a newspaper or on a billboard\u2014the art director creates a rough layout using a computer. The layout shows where the copy will go, which fonts and colors will be used, and what the picture will look like. At this stage, the layout must be approved by the client. Once a rough layout for an ad is approved, the art director uses all the resources of the agency to produce the finished ad.\n\u2022 Work begins in a large, open work area known as the bull pen, where the art director supervises a team of artists who work up the rough layout of an ad, refine it, and put it together on the computer. Assistants scale photographs and illustrations to the proper size and decide on the typeface. They run the copy and the photographs through the computer programs to create the pages as they will appear in print.\n\u2022 The client's first look at a television ad is in the form of a storyboard\u2014a kind of comic-strip version of the action and dialogue of the ad. The art director draws the storyboard as a model for the filmed ad. Many people help prepare an ad for television. The art director and the copywriter then join forces with a producer, who handles the budget and the technical details. All three choose a director to film or tape the ad. The art director also helps to cast the actors for a television advertisement\u2014they must have the \"look\" the art director wants.\n\nQualifications\n\n\u2022 A portfolio containing a collection of best work\n\u2022 Training in graphic design, including courses in typography, design, layout, and photography.\n\u2022 Ability to work under constant pressure as there are always deadlines to meet, layouts to deliver to the printer, or commercials that must be taped as soon as possible. (Delays in the production of a television commercial can be very expensive, and the art director is ultimately responsible for having everything ready on time and staying until the shooting is finished.)\n\u2022 Expertise in Photoshop and Illustrator is essential.\n\u2022 Proficiency in Flash and Dreamweaver is strongly desired .\n\nDDB is committed to diversity in its workforce and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and to review all of our job postings to minimize biased language.

An art director and a copywriter (who writes the ads) may decide on an advertising concept together. Then they determine how the ad will look and what it will say.\n\u2022 To create a \"print\" ad\u2014one that appears in a magazine or a newspaper or on a billboard\u2014the art director creates a rough layout using a computer. The layout shows where the copy will go, which fonts and colors will be used, and what the picture will look like. At this stage, the layout must be approved by the client. Once a rough layout for an ad is approved, the art director uses all the resources of the agency to produce the finished ad.\n\u2022 Work begins in a large, open work area known as the bull pen, where the art director supervises a team of artists who work up the rough layout of an ad, refine it, and put it together on the computer. Assistants scale photographs and illustrations to the proper size and decide on the typeface. They run the copy and the photographs through the computer programs to create the pages as they will appear in print.\n\u2022 The client's first look at a television ad is in the form of a storyboard\u2014a kind of comic-strip version of the action and dialogue of the ad. The art director draws the storyboard as a model for the filmed ad. Many people help prepare an ad for television. The art director and the copywriter then join forces with a producer, who handles the budget and the technical details. All three choose a director to film or tape the ad.

                "Chemistry is looking for a senior art director to up our game, make work real people talk about, and help us win new business on our path to being one of the best creative agencies in the country.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be working across a variety of accounts we have now and throwing in on new business. Your main accounts will be a nationally famous burger chain that\u2019s new to advertising, a shipping insurance company, and a company famous for paint that\u2019s looking to be famous for more.\r\n\r\nThis is a great fit for you if you have a high attention to craft, and also believe that art directors can and should contribute to concepts and scripts. You love getting to production and making things happen. It\u2019d be great if you love getting scrappy on set and helping make things happen. Best case scenario: you\u2019re a Senior Art Director (or midlevel ready to be senior) and you\u2019re looking to focus on making great work to build out a killer book and continue to grow your skills.\r\n\r\nWe believe everything is an experiment, so come ready to try what\u2019s worked at your other jobs and try some new things, too.\r\n\r\nIdeally, you\u2019ve made a little bit of everything from social to experiential to video (with and without good budgets), and you\u2019re ready to take that experience and churn out even better versions of everything in your book, while also teaching up and coming creatives all the tricks of your trade.\r\n\r\nYou like to mentor, you ask follow-up questions, and you\u2019re comfortable in front of a client. You don\u2019t mind calling out problems when you see them, and you\u2019re proactive in getting them fixed so we can all make better work.\r\n\r\nAwards are nice. A book full of killer solutions is even better. Bonus points if you\u2019ve taught, mentored, and helped pave the way for other talent as you\u2019ve come up.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re open to candidates from anywhere, but you\u2019ll need to move to Atlanta eventually.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n4+ years' experience as an art director\r\nCreative Suite is like your BFF\r\nProcreate is also very near and dear to your heart\r\nMotion graphics work a plus\r\nExperience with video production: Ranging from self-shot social stuff to working with outside production companies' pre-production through post-production.\r\nComfortable presenting to clients"
